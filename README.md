# README Generator

![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-orange)

## Description

The goal of this project was to create a command line tool for generating a quality README so that more time could be spent working on the project rather than crafting a README each time. The tool is initialized on the command line with node index.js and using the Inquirer module, it asks a series of prompts which will fill out the needed sections of the README. It also has error handling in case there is an issue with the file generation done via the FS module.
